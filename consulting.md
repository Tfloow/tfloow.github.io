## Acknowledgement and Awards

### McKinsey Digital Workshop

In September 2024, I had the opportunity to spend 3 days at McKinsey for a workshop about generative AI and to learn more about the work done at McKinsey Digital. It was an enriching experience where I could meet and talk with McKinsey consultant but also with other fellow students that all got selected.

All students selected were chosen because they excelled at the first of the four part of McKinsey recruitment process. The first part consists of demonstrating your problem solving skills.
