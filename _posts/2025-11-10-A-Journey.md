If I did everything right, this small blog post should be pushed on my birthday. I should be 22 years old at this time and I wanted to pause for a second and share my story and battles.

- [The genesis](#the-genesis)
  - [Childhood](#childhood)
  - [COVID](#covid)
  - [Bachelor](#bachelor)
  - [The Cornerstone](#the-cornerstone)
  - [Climbing up the slope](#climbing-up-the-slope)
- [Reflection \& What to come](#reflection--what-to-come)

I started writing this around early of June 2025. It is a form of testimony, a way for me to express to the world how I feel, a way for me to show the real me. The "me" that is finally in line with myself, the one that faced his demons, traumas and anxieties. I hope I won't let this post incomplete.
