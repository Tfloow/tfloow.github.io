I'm excited to announce that a friend and I have just completed a new report for one of our university classes! This project gave us the opportunity to dive deep into the impact of ICT tools on modern teaching systems taking KU Leuven as a prime example.

Working together, we learned a lot and enjoyed the process of researching and writing. If you're interested in how technology and sustainability intersect in education, feel free to check out our full report below.

We also propose some ideas to further reduce this impact and how Universities can embrace new digital tool.

Let us know your thoughts and feedback!
