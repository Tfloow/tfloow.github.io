My name is Thomas Debelle and I am M.Sc. student at ESAT (KU Leuven Electrical Engineering Department). I am currently pursuing a master in Electronics & Chip Design with a touch of cybersecurity (*cause I love it*).

$$i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}|\Psi (t)\rangle =\hat {H}|\Psi (t)\rangle$$

I am also a passionate cyclist. Cyclism provides me the freedom I yearn when I am sitting for too long on my chair but also the discipline and the taste of always giving your best under any circumstances. 

$$F_{\rm {d}}\,=\,{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,u^{2}\,c_{\rm {d}}\,A$$

## Why this website

This blog / Online business card / CV / whatever I may call it will be my own personal space where I compiled all the work and projects I've done over the year. But also a space where I will write some essaye in hope to be fully ready when I'll tackle the task of writing my own master's thesis in 2025/2026. I know there is still a long way ahead but I'd better be ready when this inevitable task will come up. 

$$n_i = n_0 2^{(y_i - y_0)/T_2}$$

This website is also a sort of a time capsule for me to look back to what I've done and to where I am heading towards. The idea of leaving a bit of a digital footprint appeals me since *Human only exists because others look at them*.
